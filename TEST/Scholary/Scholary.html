            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Scholary, where we delve into the world of food recipes and personal preferences. In this scholarly exploration, we aim to analyze and understand the structure, semantics, and overlay of food-related content, tailored to individual tastes and interests.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="structure">
            <h2>Structure</h2>
            <p>In this section, we will discuss the structure of our food-based content, focusing on how recipes and personal preferences are organized and presented to the user.</p>
            <p>Food recipes and personal preferences are typically structured in a clear and intuitive manner to facilitate ease of understanding and navigation for the user. Recipes often start with a list of ingredients followed by step-by-step instructions on how to prepare the dish. Personal preferences may include dietary restrictions, flavor preferences, and ingredient substitutions. Once we can develop a data base things will be better structured. For now we only have a basic implementation. We aim to have everything organized and easy to acces</p>
        </section>

        <section id="semantics">
            <h2>Semantics Overlay</h2>
            <p>Here, we will examine the semantics overlay of food-related information, exploring the meaning and significance behind various culinary elements and practices.</p>
            <p>Culinary semantics involve the interpretation and understanding of food-related concepts, such as flavor profiles, cooking techniques, and cultural significance. By analyzing these elements, we can gain insight into the deeper meanings behind food choices and preferences.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In conclusion, our exploration of food recipes and personal preferences has provided valuable insights into the organization, semantics, and overlay of culinary content. By understanding these aspects, we can better cater to individual tastes and preferences, enhancing the overall food experience.</p>
